## 🚀 Getting Started

Getting started with glass-refraction does not require any programming skills. You can download ready-made files and explore examples or use simple HTML and CSS to try the styles.

The design system combines CSS styles with React components. React components are pre-coded parts of a web page that you can plug in to create interactive interfaces. Even if you don’t use React yourself, you can still enjoy the CSS portion to style web pages.
